# Cross-bearing localization
This repo contains results from cross-bearing localization of low-frequency microbarom data (0.15-0.35 Hz), within 1 hour time windows.
The results are available as *netcdf* files, with each file spanning 1 month from the start of 2021 to the end of 2023.
The files can easily be view using the **Panoply** netcdf data viewer.
